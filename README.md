# javascript_library
A comprehensive library of JavaScript core data types, features, methods and techniques

This repo is here as a resource for you, to provide you quick access to a comprehensive set of working examples of JavaScript.

Most of the code is oriented toward console output, for rapid testing, but some of the code is embedded in HTML.

This library will be updated and expanded on a regular basis.
